## Chip8
This is the emulation of Chip8 (architecture along with interpreter). <br>
It loads rom from the \*.ch8 file and plays by emulating the chip8. <br> <br>
Flickers are inevitable cause that's how original chip8 used to draw to the display. Every pixel are XOR'd with new pixels to draw the image which causes flicker when redrawing the same image. <br> <br>
